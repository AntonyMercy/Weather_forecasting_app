**Weather Forecasting App**

**Project Overview**
The Weather Forecasting App provides users with real-time weather information and a 7-day forecast based on their location. The app features a clean, responsive UI developed with Flutter and a backend API built with Node.js.

**Getting Started**

Frontend (Flutter)

Prerequisites:
    - Flutter SDK: Ensure Flutter is installed. Follow the Flutter installation guide if needed.
    - Android Studio: Installed with Flutter and Dart plugins.

Installation:

1.Clone the repository:

     git clone <repository-url>
     
2.Open the Project in Android Studio:

     - Launch Android Studio.
     - Select Open an existing project.
     - Navigate to the cloned repository and open the frontend directory.
     
3.Install Dependencies:
     - Open the terminal in Android Studio (View > Tool Windows > Terminal).
     - Run
     
          flutter pub get
          
4.Configure API Keys:
    - Create a file named api_keys.dart in lib/config/ and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
    
        const String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
        
5.Run the App:
    - Ensure an Android emulator or device is connected.
    - Click the green play button in Android Studio or run the following command in the terminal:
    
        flutter run

Backend (Node.js)

Prerequisites:

    - Node.js
    - npm or yarn
    
Installation:

1.Navigate to the backend directory:

    cd backend
    
2.Install dependencies:

    npm install
        or
    yarn install
    
3.Configure environment variables in a .env file (see .env.example for template):

    API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
    PORT=3000
    
4.Start the server:

    npm start
        or
    yarn start

**Architecture and Design**

Frontend

    - lib/: Contains all Flutter Dart code.
      - models/: Data models for weather and forecast.
      - screens/: UI screens (HomeScreen, DetailsScreen).
      - providers/: State management solutions.
      - services/: API services for weather data.
      - widgets/: Reusable UI components.
    - State Management: Uses Provider for managing app state.
    - API Integration: Communicates with the backend API to fetch weather data.
  
Backend
  - Folder Structure:
    - src/: Contains server code.
      - controllers/: API endpoint controllers.
      - models/: Data models.
      - routes/: API route definitions.
      - services/: Business logic and data handling.
      - utils/: Utility functions and error handling.
  - API Endpoints:
    - GET /weather: Fetch current weather data.
    - GET /forecast: Fetch 7-day weather forecast.
  - Database: If applicable, include details on database schema.
  - Error Handling: Centralized error handling in middleware/errorHandler.js.

**Features**

Frontend
  - Home Screen: Displays current weather and 7-day forecast.
  - Details Screen: Shows detailed weather information for each forecast day.
  - Search Functionality: Users can search for weather information in different locations.
    
Backend
  - Endpoints:
      - /weather: Returns current weather data.
      - /forecast: Returns 7-day forecast data.
  - Authentication: Uses API key for weather service access.
  - Data Handling: Fetches and processes data from OpenWeatherMap API.

**Testing**

Frontend
  - Unit Tests: Tests for individual components and logic.
  - Widget Tests: Tests for critical UI components and interactions.

Backend
  - Unit Tests: Tests for individual modules and functions.
  - Integration Tests: Tests for API endpoints and interactions.

**Performance Optimization**

Frontend
  - Optimized UI rendering and asynchronous data fetching.
  - Implemented caching for offline support.
    
Backend
  - Optimized API response times and data processing.

**Error Handling and Debugging**

Frontend
  - Handles network errors, API errors, and user input issues with user-friendly messages.
    
Backend
  - Logs errors and handles exceptions with meaningful responses.
